# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to analyze the outcomes of campaigns, based on what their
fundraising goals where and what date they launched on. If we are able to identify the 
fundraising goals with the highest levels of success and the best time of year to launch a 
campaign, then we will be able to tell Louise how her play Fever, fared against the rest, as well 
as give advice on how to set herself up for success in the future.  


## Analysis and Challenges

The largest challenge was becoming familiar with the data and remembering how it 
needed to be filtered, based on what Louise was asking for. I performed my analysis by 
reviewing the graphs and identifying common themes within ranges and amongst different elements. 
As you can see below, the chart quickly identifies that May is the best time of year to launch a 
campaign in order for it to be successful.

Similiarly, based on the next graph, we are able to quickly identify that budgets less than 5000,
have the highest success rate.

I overcame my challenges by going back to the raw data and verifying that the totals I had gathered 
in my pivot tables and calculations matched what I was filtering in the raw data. 

I felt that if someone is comfortable with pivot tables & graphs, the biggest hurdle 
would be to remember the small details that make a big difference. It’s always 
important to make sure that your parameters match what the client has asked for. 


## Results

### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The first conclusion to be made is that the best time to launch a campaign is in May, 
followed by June, then July. The final conclusion is that the worst time of year to launch a 
campaign is in December. The rate at which campaigns fail is increased while the success 
rate significantly decreases. 


### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

In order to have a 60% or greater chance of achieving your campaign Goal, it is best to have 
a goal that is either less  $5,000 or between $35,000 and $44,999. Anything outside of those 
ranges, leaves you with a greater likelihood of not meeting your final goal, or your likelihood 
of achieving your goal is almost as great as your likelihood to fall short of the campaign goal. 


### What are some limitations of this dataset?

In order to provide the best feedback and set future campaigns up for success, it would be 
most helpful to combine both the Success rate, based on Goal ranges with the best time of 
year to start a campaign. Although there are several years of data in our dataset, it would be 
helpful to analyze and identify any shifts in the success of the campaigns, year over year. It’s 
also a challenge when not all of the currency is the same. 

### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

In addition to the two graphs that we built, it would be interesting to build a graph that 
showed the volume of campaigns by Category, year over year in additional to the overall 
success rate of the campaigns year over year. A second idea would be to identify success 
rates by country and time of year, which may identify seasonal correlations.
